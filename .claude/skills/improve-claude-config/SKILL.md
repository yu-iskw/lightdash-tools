# Improve Claude Configuration

## Purpose

This skill enables Claude Code to evolve and improve its own configuration based on observed patterns, user feedback, and development needs.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- You've explained the same concept to Claude multiple times
- Claude repeatedly makes the same type of mistake
- A new workflow pattern has emerged that should be automated
- Hooks could prevent recurring issues
- New skills would benefit the project

## Self-Improvement Workflow

### 1. Analyze Current State

Read and understand the current configuration:

```bash
# View CLAUDE.md
read_file CLAUDE.md

# List all skills
list_dir .claude/skills/

# List all agents
list_dir .claude/agents/

# View current hooks
read_file .claude/settings.json
```

### 2. Identify Improvement Opportunity

| Pattern                     | Action                             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Repeated explanation        | Add to CLAUDE.md or create a skill |
| Recurring mistake           | Add rule to CLAUDE.md              |
| Manual repetitive task      | Create a hook                      |
| Complex workflow            | Create a skill                     |
| Specialized task delegation | Create an agent                    |

### 3. Implement Improvement

#### Adding Rules to CLAUDE.md

For project conventions or gotchas Claude keeps forgetting:

```markdown
## Recent Learnings (append to CLAUDE.md)

- [Date]: Description of rule and why it matters
```

#### Creating a New Skill

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with standard structure.

#### Creating a New Hook

Add to `.claude/settings.json` and create the corresponding script in `.claude/hooks/`.

### 4. Validate Changes

1. Verify JSON syntax in `settings.json`.
2. Test hooks if added.
3. Verify skill loads correctly.

## Best Practices

1. **Be minimal**: Only add what's necessary
2. **Be specific**: Vague rules are ignored
3. **Test changes**: Validate hooks and skills work
4. **Version control**: Commit configuration changes with clear messages
