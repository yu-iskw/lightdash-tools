# Lightdash HTTP client design

The Lightdash HTTP client design is specified in OpenSpec:

- **Change:** [docs/openspec/changes/lightdash-http-client/](../openspec/changes/lightdash-http-client/)
- **Artifacts:** `proposal.md`, `specs/lightdash-http-client/spec.md`, `design.md`

See the OpenSpec change for proposal (why/what), specifications (requirements and scenarios), and design (auth, transport, error handling, testing strategy). Implementation will follow in a separate change (tasks and code in `packages/client`).
